pyimgvwr
========
pyimgvwr is a simple image viewer. Goal is to be minimalistic and focus on displaying one image at a time - not a thumbnail browser. Initially most navigation and commands will be via keyboard rather than a gui.

** Current Features **
 * full screen
 * image scaling to fit window
 * forward/back through directory of images via arrow keys


** Planned Features ** 
 * Scan directory for changes to list of image files - automatically display new image
 * play slideshow - w/ keyboard commands for reversing direction, randomizing/sorting order, etc.
 * 

** Distant Future Features **
 * A flyover GUI to control most features in addition  to the keyboard commands (similar to what Fastone does with its full screen hot zones)
