This is a project to accomplish a few goals: 
1. To have something to do with my Raspberry Pi
1. To learn python better 
1. To produce an image viewer that has certain features - mostly keyboard control of slideshow types of things. I know there are a lot of them out there already, but I won't learn python by using an existing image viewer.
